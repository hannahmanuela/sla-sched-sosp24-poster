\section{Related Work}

Other systems have tried to address the same problem in different ways. 

There is a large body of work that focusses on removing the need for
reservations by creating elastic reservations that automatically scale up and
down with load (TODO citations - pigeon, sparrow, kubernetes?). These systems
generally operate on a much larger timescale (control loops on the order of
manys seconds (TODO citation)), and still work within the best effort - latency
critical binary. 

There are systems that focus on increasing utilization so that resources
temporarily unused by latency crticial jobs can be repurposed by best effort
work (TODO cite caladan, also shinjuku?). This alleviates the symptom of
over-subscription, under utilization, without addressing the root cause. It too
works within the best effort - latency critical binary. 

There are systems that are purely deadline-based, but take different appproach
to realizing those deadlines. Some try to formally pre-compute compute time to
make guarantees (TODO cite Jockey), while others use the deadline to generate a
reservation (TODO cite Rayon). Morpheus (TODO add citation) targets jobs with
invocation frequencies of around a day, and infers the deadline from historic
data, automatically generating recurring reservations.

\section{Related Work}

Categories of related work: 

- work that focuses on elasticity (ie don't need reservations, just look and adapt) --> will generally be on a different time scale than what we are targeting
- work that focuses on increasing utilization (caladan) --> still deals with fundamental issues of binary work categorization (eg can't help you if you under-reserved, or if there isn't enough BE)
- work that is deadline-based
    - pretty formal (Jockey)
    - infer the deadline themselves, generate recurring reservations (Morpheus)
    - generate deadlines from SLAs (Rayon)

- key ways we are generally different:
    - EDF on the single machine, combined with the associated admission control
    - slack as an explicit metric that is used on the global level
    - are deadline-based but have guarantees
